      <p>
        I once chose economics over commerce because accounting gave me a headache — true story. What followed was a master’s degree and a deep dive into research, which I took so seriously I ended up in a research cell. These days, I consult more than I research, compete more than I chill, and recently, I’ve started swinging golf clubs (watch out, Tiger). I like ideas, puzzles, and making things — whether it’s through code, strategy, or a well-timed putt.

  I’m always up for trying something new — especially if it’s food I probably shouldn’t eat before a long trip. I like slow mornings, quiet corners in unfamiliar cafés, and menus with too many brunch options. My days usually begin with green tea and a long mental to-do list. I write sometimes — about fitness, food, and figuring life out — over on

  </a>

  These days, I lead a team, plan sprints, and find calm in long walks, quiet writing, and things that smell like roasted coffee and progress.

        Mommy wants me to talk to strangers but I don't want to. I prefer napping in the sun, chasing invisible things, and pretending I don’t understand “sit.” <strong>You can contact me for further details on her schedule, but don't expect a response anytime soon.</strong>

        Welcome to a glimpse into <em>her</em> journey... I hijacked it as Coco but as Kimchi, I'm just the cute part of it.

  <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m Aakriti — curious by nature, competitive in spirit, and a believer in quiet confidence. I’ve always gravitated toward ideas, people, and paths that feel meaningful. Whether it’s leading a team, writing a new piece, or learning something completely outside my comfort zone, I like to keep moving forward — with purpose, perspective, and a little bit of joy along the way.
